            Our mission is to showcase the Collaboration of Talents between <strong>musicians</strong>, <strong>camera operators</strong>, and <strong>audio engineers</strong> through rich visual media and production-quality live sound recordings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through performances and interviews we explore the Artistsâ€™ individual paths as well as the Universal Truths that drive their artistic expression.

            Our artist interviews focus on the participation that takes place on and off the screen. At times you may see our Producer perform, or even our Sound Engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            So sit back, grab a pair of your favorite headphones, turn down the lights and play back on one of our spirited performances.
